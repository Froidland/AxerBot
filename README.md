The bot also interacts with osu!'s API v2 and [the BN/NAT Management website](https://bn.mappersguild.com/)'s interOp routes to provide you with multiple stats and management systems such as:

- An OAuth2 verification system where you sign up with your osu! account in order to be granted access to the server

- Several commands that allow you to view your playing/mapping stats from the osu! website or the BN/NAT website

## Usage

- invite the bot.
- type `-help` to see a list of all available commands; Use `-help <command>` to see how a specific command works.
- if the `-` prefix doesn't suit you, feel free to change it via the `-setprefix` command.

from this step onwards, you can set up any of these following systems as a server owner/manager:

- The osu! verification system
- The logging channel
- The quotes system
- The command cooldowns system
